| `App()` : contains and protects routes ('/', '/watchlist', '/search'), and tracks user state |1|
| `AuthPage()` : tracks user form state and allows users to sign up and sign in, storing the user in `App` state with callbacks (just like in the inventory app) |1|
| `SearchPage()` : renders items already watched differently. If it is not already watched, on click of the item, set the item as `watched` in supabase and refetch all items from supabase to be rerendered. |1|
| `WatchlistPage()` :  tracks `listItems` in state, and fetches them on load |1|
| `MovieItem()` : renders items already on watchlist differently. If it is not on watchlist, on click of the item, add the item to the watchlist and refetch all items from supabase to be rerendered |1|
